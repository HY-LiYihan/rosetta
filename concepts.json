      "prompt": "Throughout the semantic construal of human experience, there is a differentiation between two orders of reality: between the everyday reality of our material existence on the one hand and on the other hand the second-order reality that is brought into existence only by the system of language. One of the paths for realizing second-order reality is Projection, whereby the sequential relation between two figures projects one of them onto the plane of second-order semiotic phenomena, thus enabling it to enter the realm of metaphenomena. Therefore, Projection is defined as relating \"phenomena of one order of experience\", which refer to the processes of saying or thinking, to \"phenomena order\", which is what people say or think. That is to say, the projected clause indicates a locution or an idea. What's worth mentioning is Fact as projected which doesn't rely on certain Sayer or Sener and is usually indicated with embedding.\nIn terms of taxis within clause complexes, which helps understanding Projection forms of types above, Projection can be divided into Quotation, Reporting and Embedding, respectively corresponding to parataxis, hypotaxis and modifiers of nominal groups. Also, there is a special form called Free Indirect Speech that has the characteristics of both Quotation and Reporting. ",

      "prompt": "Reference is a cohesive device that allow the speaker to indicate whether something is being repeated from somewhere earlier in the text or whether it has not yet appeared in the text. It has two main categories One is Exophoric Reference, which means that the identity presumed by the reference item can be recovered from the external context. The other is Endophoric Reference, where the identity presumed by the reference item is recovered in the internal context. Endophoric Reference has two sub-categories. If the reference is referring backwards to the previous contexts, it is an Anaphoric Reference; if the reference is referring forwards to the messages developed later, it is a Cataphoric Reference. There are three main types of cohesive reference. The first type, Personal Reference, includes the third-person personal pronouns (his, her, it). The second type Demonstrative Reference includes demonstratives like this/that, these/those, here/there, and now/then, the, etc. The third type Comparative Reference signals something by reference to which the speaker is talking about is the same or different, like or unlike, equal or unequal, more or less. Some prompts words in the third type include \"another\", \"different\", \"the same\" \"similarly\" and ordinal numbers, etc. ",
