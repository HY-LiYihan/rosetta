      "prompt": "Throughout the semantic construal of human experience, there is a differentiation between two orders of reality: between the everyday reality of our material existence on the one hand and on the other hand the second-order reality that is brought into existence only by the system of language. One of the paths for realizing second-order reality is Projection, whereby the sequential relation between two figures projects one of them onto the plane of second-order semiotic phenomena, thus enabling it to enter the realm of metaphenomena. Therefore, Projection is defined as relating “phenomena of one order of experience”, which refer to the processes of saying or thinking, to “phenomena order”, which is what people say or think. That is to say, the projected clause indicates a locution or an idea. What’s worth mentioning is Fact as projected which doesn’t rely on certain Sayer or Sener and is usually indicated with embedding.\nIn terms of taxis within clause complexes, which helps understanding Projection forms of types above, Projection can be divided into Quotation, Reporting and Embedding, respectively corresponding to parataxis, hypotaxis and modifiers of nominal groups. Also, there is a special form called Free Indirect Speech that has the characteristics of both Quotation and Reporting. ",

The other is Endophoric Reference, where the identity presumed by the reference item is recovered in the internal context. Endophoric Reference has two sub-categories. If the reference is referring backwards to the previous contexts, it is an Anaphoric Reference; if the reference is referring forwards to the messages developed later, it is a Cataphoric Reference. There are three main types of cohesive reference. The first type, Personal Reference, includes the third-person personal pronouns (his, her, it). The second type Demonstrative Reference includes demonstratives like this/that, these/those, here/there, and now/then, the, etc. The third type Comparative Reference signals something by reference to which the speaker is talking about is the same or different, like or unlike, equal or unequal, more or less. Some prompts words in the third type include “another”, “different”, “the same” “similarly” and ordinal numbers, etc. ",

      "name": "nominalization",
      "prompt": "Nominalization is the key phenomenon in ideational metaphors and core realization form of grammatical metaphors. Grammatical metaphor refers to a shift in the congruent lexical-grammatical form for the same meaning. The congruent form, which is the direct expression of meaning, matches the one-to-one mapping between semantic processes and their corresponding lexical-grammatical structures. In contrast, grammatical metaphor represents a non-congruent form of expression. And nominalization refers to the use of a nominal form to express a process meaning. To elaborate, it transforms grammatical units originally functioning as verbs or adjectives into noun phrases. For example, “they did a dance” nominalize the action of dance, while “the dance amazes the audience” isn’t nominalization. Also, with functions of packaging information, enhancing logical cohesion and creating objectivization, it serves as a crucial device for constructing formal registers like academic and scientific discourses.
